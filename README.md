# Airline Analysis Project
## Overview
This project analyzes aircraft data to support decision-making for an aviation business expansion by identifying aircraft with lower operational risk and better performance.

## Business Understanding
The objective of this analysis is to help stakeholders choose suitable aircraft models for a new business venture by evaluating operational risk, cost, and performance factors.

## Data Understanding
- Dataset includes aircraft and airline operational information
- The dataset had 2500 rows and 8 columns
- Used to compare aircraft suitability for expansion
- There were 118 missing values and 1199

## Data Cleaning
The following steps were performed:
- Removed missing values
- Dropped duplicate records
- Standardized column names and data types

## Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA was conducted to examine relationships between aircraft type, operational cost, and performance metrics using multiple visualizations.

## Key Findings
- Certain aircraft models show lower operational risk
- Fuel efficiency varies significantly across aircraft categories
- Larger aircraft tend to have higher cost variability

## Recommendations
- Prioritize aircraft with stable operational performance
- Avoid high-risk aircraft models during early expansion
- Use data-driven evaluation for future fleet decisions
